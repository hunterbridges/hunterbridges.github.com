              Can you wrap your fingers around the wall?<br />
              Watch you send your letters through lines of code.<br />
              Did the income set? Did the check make it into my account?<br />
              What you've got is everything you have left.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, it takes too much resolve to keep a straight face.<br />
              I'm the worst at managing arguments.<br />
              Do you even care? Do you even realize you have effect?<br />
              If you want me to feed you, I give you my defense:
            </p>
            <p>
              Can't you see I've won? Can't you see I've won?<br />
              Can't you see I've won? Woah, woah…<br />
              I'm not too nice!
            </p>
            <p>
              Tumbling back, we all end right where we began,<br />
              But so much worse. If we could only go back in time.<br />
              Live more. Speed up. Pass me by.<br />
              Taunt me. Chase me 'til I die.
            </p>
            <p>
              Can't you see I've won? Can't you see I've won?<br />
              Can't you see I've won? Woah, woah…<br />
              I'm not too nice!

              I want to get some shut-eye, but I can't stop this twitch<br />
              Glaring at the room's side; that's not gonna soothe my itch!<br />
              But now I tread the inside, a nightly march in a backlit glow,<br />
              Eluding me with enzymes; and I just can't help thinking about it!
            </p>
            <p>
              Woah, do your arms shake behind the bow?<br />
              Cause when your blood starts pumping then you better be ready to go.<br />
              Why does your time have effect on me?<br />
              When are you gonna take control?!
            </p>
            <p>
              Now it's so far away, skating the sawtooth horizon.<br />
              Masted fabrics spherize; I'm captive by the wind!<br />
              The sea matches the sky. Will I find the light again?<br />
              Am I chasing night life, or am I chasing sin?
            </p>
            <p>
              Woah, do your arms shake behind the bow?<br />
              Cause when your blood starts pumping then you better be ready to go.<br />
              Why does your time have effect on me?<br />
              When are you gonna take–<br />
              When are you gonna take control?!
            </p>
            <p>
              What say you when I find out I'm upside-down?<br />
              Can't we just see eye-to-eye?<br />
              I'm pleased to see the fate we're sharing here.<br />
              Now if only I could touch you to know you're real…
            </p>
            <p>
              Woah, do your arms shake behind the bow?<br />

              Place your bets.<br />
              If your aim was steady I know you wouldn't worry so bad.<br />
              Sue the minute when you<br />
              Start to worry 'bout the things you should have never said.<br />
              Why do I have to teach you?

              Push a little further!<br />
              It's black and white!<br />
              Don't you want to know the answer?

              Silence! Delays!<br />
              Action! Anticipate…<br />
              Slip! Climb!<br />
              Breathe! Suffocate…

              You don't understand what I'm telling you anyway&hellip;<br />
              Lost in the filter (Or it stopped before it got there)<br />
              You have will what you hear,<br />
              But you can't control what you're being told!

              Eighteen more days to understand you&hellip;<br />
              Where's your mind?<br />
              Staring through the mirror!<br />
              Kept in line<br />
              By introspective murder!
            </p>
            <p>
              You look wet,<br />
              But I'm sure this heat will quickly make you dry!<br />
              It's diminished, are you?<br />
              You know the tricks, and you've learned 'em in the blink of an eye.<br />
              Why did I have to teach you?
