title: On Our Unfortunate Age of Irony
description:
---
Last year I saw two editorials come about. They concerned the state of modern
culture in America. In the published responses that followed, and through the
social media ripple beyond those, a provoking argument emerged. It says that
Generation Y’s potential for contributing to cultural history will be lost in a
flood of derivation and irony. The worst case is that the effect lasts for
generations to come.

I read the first article last January, Kurt Andersen’s [“You
Say You Want a Devolution?”](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2012/01/prisoners-of-style-201201)
for Vanity Fair. Andersen brought forth some interesting ideas. The
first was that 2000s-era culture became increasingly remix-driven. Second,
that decade saw an emergence of self-proclaimed “stylists” or “editors.” Finally,
rapid development in information technology has made troves of historical
material accessible to those wannabe stylists, and that same technology
has positioned them to remix our beloved Western culture into oblivion.

I found those notions intriguing, but I wasn’t satisfied. I have spent a while
observing the music industry, though not as microscopically as some of my peers.
I believe the music industry can help to inform us of our culture state,
and I admit it’s not the whole picture. I have tried to pay more attention to the
music industry’s cultural aspects than to the money, but the harshest fact I’ve
learned is that there is some big tasteless money out there. But for that dumb
money to be there, it had to come from somewhere, right?

Andersen also makes the assertion that corporations have become very good at
commoditizing “creative” wares. Corporations tend to optimize their
goods for their market. They make the most money by providing the lowest cost
viable product that sells to the most number of people. In the arts,
most consumers have not developed their taste to the point where they know
what truly pleases them, but are quick to identify what they dislike. In creative
commodities, purchasibility is opposite of displeasure. So, corporations exist
in the world whose goal it is to produce the “art” that offends the least number
of people. There’s a market for it. It’s just business.

The recording industry is young. About a century ago, wax cylinder
gramophones were disrupting the sheet music industry. Then and there was a
turning point. The only way to consume sheet music was by reading and performing
it, or at least having someone around who could. Those talents required
aristocratic training. With recordings, those barriers were gone. The privilege
of enjoying music was unlimited. In the 2000s, broadband helped the internet
develop into a pervasive multimedia machine. Digital distribution was reasonable
for the first time. It became popular because it was cheap and easy.
People who didn’t value culture at all were finally able to consume it for a
cost they were satisfied with: zero. The ability to mold their tasteless brains
into blind advocates still proved valuable for the corporations, who were in a
better position than anyone to claim the territory. Obviously they moved in.

So why did the faceless mass buy into it? I fancy myself a creative person,
so I turned the question inward. Why do I create art? Why do
I seek out good material? Why is it so important to decide which music, books,
and films I enjoy? Those are simpler questions. I do all that to express myself.
I express myself because it shapes my identity and justifies my existence. There
are more reasons, but I feel those are the elemental ones I share with
every other creative person. Having a shaped identity and a justified
existence is kind of nice too, so I really can’t blame anyone for desiring
self-expression.

In November, I read [“How to Live Without Irony”](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/)
by Christy Wampole of the New York Times. It exhibited a more targeted idea:
the internet has enabled members of Generation Y to become comfortable
expressing themselves through irony. The tentpole of this ironic culture is,
of course, **the hipster**. She acknowledges the same nostalgic infatuation
among the guilty as Andersen. In her conclusion, Wampole makes a plea for
Gen-Y’ers to repair our inviable culture, as it “equals a surrender to
commercial and political entities.” I believe she did not properly find
where Generation Y’s culture truly lies. I haven’t found it either.

Admittedly, Generation Y is at a slight disdvantage. As our generation has
entered into what is supposed to be our cultural prime, we don’t have the
benefit of open air.  The signal-to-noise ratio has never been lower (And all
the whining makes it worse). A crowd of twentysomethings is trying to break into
the old-guard world of journalism. To keep their jobs, all of them would be
willing to sputter some bullshit about the latest “Call Me Maybe.”
In my opinion, that is a fair compromise. The generations who say we have
nothing to contribute are the people writing our paychecks.

Despite all of this, there is hope. I see potential. I see opportunity.
I see intimidation in the eyes of those who look at the tools the next
culturally significant generation will wield. I agree with Wampole in that I
believe the hipster phenomenon to be unsustainable, but I disagree with
Andersen and don’t think our culture is in decline. The rapid development of
technology represents undiscovered territory, and corporations won’t move fast
enough to keep up. It is possible for us to develop keener eyes and more
sensitive ears, and for us to use these new tools to filter and dissemminate.
Good stuff is out there, the challenge is that it is too difficult for many
people to tell which is which.

Individually, we can’t be too proud. That is a large problem we’re
fighting against. For one person self-expression is justified, but building
a culture must be cooperative. We must believe that any of us may very well have
awful taste, so perhaps it is not so important that we all be a curator.
Aspirational taste should not represent a way to gain status, it should
represent an intimidating burden and responsibility to our peers.

If we don’t take advantage of this opportunity, Western culture will still
stand. The next generation will come along, perhaps the one after them,
and they will see the same landscape. They will see that in our fervent
pretentiousness we individually failed to be humble, and as a generation failed
to contribute to a greater cultural whole. They won’t make the same mistakes.
They will live the dreams we weren’t able to achieve. They will make their
statement, and we will just have been the “noisy generation.” Life will go on,
but we’ll have suffered the shame of wasting all our artistry just because
we only let the world notice the wannabes.
